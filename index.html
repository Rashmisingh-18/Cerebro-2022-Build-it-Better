            Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing,
            Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt
            Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.

            Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as
            Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other
            superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had
            been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.

            Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America,
            Thor, Hulk, Wolverine, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers, the
            X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of well-known supervillains includes
            the likes of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, Thanos, Green Goblin, and Kingpin. Most of Marvel's fictional
            characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life
            places; many major characters are based in New York City.Additionally, Marvel has published several
            licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and again
            since 2015.
